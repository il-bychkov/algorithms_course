# How to run practice code examples

All sources are placed in `src` directory in practice folder - for example in `0_intro/src`.

## Simple way

Use online gcc compiler - https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler. Just copy and paste source code and press run.

## Hard way

All code for practice developed on WSL with following environment:
```
Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS
gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0
cmake version 3.16.3
```

You can install WSL on your Windows pc (or just install gcc and cmake if you use Linux or Mac) and run script `build.sh` in practice folder - for example in `0_intro/practice`. After this all example binaries will be placed into `bin` folder and you can run it.

### WSL and tools installation instructions

Google it! Or use simple way.
